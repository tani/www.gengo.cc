Hi, I am TANIGUCHI Masaya üëã

Masaya Taniguchi graduated from the Information Science Course at P<TITECH HST|Tokyo Tech High School of Science and Technology>. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics from Gakushuin University, followed by his M.S. and Ph.D. in Information Science from P<JAIST|Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology>.

Presently, he holds the position of a researcher (P<SPDR|Special Postdoctoral Researcher>) in the Natural Language Understanding team at P<RIKEN AIP|RIKEN Advanced Intelligence Project>. Additionally, he is a member of P<Tohoku NLP|Research group for Natural Language Processing at Tohoku University>, led by Dr. Kentaro Inui, at Tohoku University.

Masaya Taniguchi's research primarily focuses on formal semantics of natural language and programming languages. His keen interests lie in exploring and advancing the understanding of these domains.
