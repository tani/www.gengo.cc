The essence of incremental parsing is to construct a partial syntactic structure stepwise from the head of a sentence.
Thus, the parsing algorithm is preferable when we analyze the process in which human listen to/ read a sentence in
the temporal order, and beneficial to reveal an intermediate state of natural language understanding and to parse a
long natural language sentence. In categorial grammar (CG) and its variants, there are incremental parsing algorithms,
but not all grammatical sentences could be parsed by these algorithms. It is empirically known that all the grammatical
sentences might be parsed incrementally by CG with combinator rules. As the previous researches were software
simulations of the incremental parsing, which did not show that they work sentences of any length. Thus far, we have
empirically shown 4 that any grammatical sentences could be incrementally parsed, however, no proofs to
this is known to us. In this paper, we show the main theorem; For the certain parsing tree generated by CG, we can
generate the equivalent parsing tree without binary nodes on the right branch by the combintor rules ùêµ, ùê∑, ùëá, where
the condition is to except the backward long reference.

One of the combinatory rules is the T combinator called a type-raising rule to
correspond with swapping a head in X-bar theory, where the head takes another
component. In CG and its variants, we parse a sentence by proving the theorem Œì
‚ä¢ S where Œì is a sequence of categories, e.g., ‚ÄúHe walks‚Äù is given by NP, NP\\S ‚ä¢
S. This proof system is known as a non-cut-free system. The non-cut-free proof
is a problem for the decidability of the sequent calculus. Hence, there is a
limitation in the usage of the rule in most CCG parsing algorithms. For example,
a parser allows the type raising only for the noun phrase. In the present paper,
we eliminate the limitation of the type-raising rule by the proof-theoretic
analysis.

The treebank corpus is a collection of the tree that represents a sentence

from the treebank, that is to decompose the tree data structure and to find

grammar so that we inspect the generative power of the obtained grammar. In
this phase, the syntactic head is a significant feature, however, in the
obtained grammar the head information is missing. Hence, we propose to
supplement the lost head information with the type-raising rule of categorial
grammar (CG). We extend the same issue to combinatory categorial grammar (CCG)

grammar by the formal proof written in the proof assistant system, Isabelle/

We aim at constructing a partial semantics structure incrementally from the beginning word of a sentence.
To achieve this property, we employ combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), which enables us to acquire a
semantic structure and a parsing tree simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce new rules as a natural
extension of existing formalisms, and in addition, we implement an interactive parser that can externalize
a parsing tree for each word input. As a result, we find a left-branching tree without employing extra
memory for floating tokens that are un-treed words. This is because categorial grammar and its derivations
have a confluence property in the simply-typed lambda calculus; that is, the reduction steps do not affect
the resultant sequence of semantics terms. Generally, we build a constituency tree structure from a sentence
using the parser with some given grammar rules, i.e., the building process is a sequence of unification
between applicable Grammar rules and a given Sentence. However, we can execute the parser in the reversal
way, as in definite clause grammar; when we execute the unification between an input Sentence and a parsed
Tree, we can replicate a set of innate Grammar rules. This system takes a sentence as input and displays the
possible parsing results in CCG. For each word input, the partial sentence is processed as follows;
1. The tree and the sentence are used to extract the grammar rules employed in the parser.
2. Based on the extracted grammar, the parser outputs all possible parsing results in CCG. The type of the
  partial tree is not uniquely determined, and so all the possible grammar rules are exhaustively consulted.

The notion of normative grammar is helpful for tagging sentences of a large corpus, that is to annotate each word by a part
of speech (POS). In this research, we aim at obtaining categorial grammar rules, where the category is a generalized notion

thus, a reliable but exhaustive search method is in demand. Here, we present a support system for the annotation by the CCG
parser based on the bidirectionality and the non-determinism in logic programming. Contrary to the common usage of the
parser, we extract a set of grammar rules from a syntax tree, and moreover, we retrieve all the probable readings with the
system. In this paper, we show the parsing algorithm and employ it for the grammar extraction. Further, we consider the
application of the algorithm to generate a sentence and to fill a masked sentence.

as the syntax type. However, we propose the new grammar, in which the semantic
type is the extension of System F to analyze the cross-serial dependencies that
are the relationship of word reference over the other references. Our grammar
has the CPS-transformation rules instead of the Dutch forward crossed composition
rule in original CCG. That rule works as the generic framework to uncross
dependency.

reflect probable progressions, which well match with our human intuition. This

music. One is that we do not need to provide a dictionary beforehand. The other
is that we can exclude the human-biased intuition, which had hindered the

Thus far, the agent communication has often been modeled in dynamic epistemic logic,
where each agent changes his/her belief, restricting the accessibility to possible worlds
in Kripke semantics. Prior to the message passing, in general, the sender should be
required to believe the contents of the message. In some occasions, however, the recipient
may not believe what he/she has heard since he/she may not have enough background knowledge
to understand it or the information may be encrypted and he/she may not know how to decipher it.
In this paper, we generalize those messages that require special knowledge as private information
and formalize that the recipient does not change his/her belief receiving such private messages.
Then, we distinguish the validity of the information from the belief change of the recipient;
that is, even though the communication itself is held and the information is logically contradictory
to his/her original belief, the recipient may not change his/her belief. For this purpose, we employ
4-valued logic where each proposition is given 2 (usual true and false) times 2 (private or public
information or not) truth value.

We introduced the notion of continuation in lambda calculus for Lambek calculus
and showed that the continuation-passing style transformation could be naturally
derived from the rules of Lambek calculus. Furthermore, since the answer category
of a continuation is given when the whole sentence is determined, we introduced a
polymorphic category and generalized the continuation-passing style transformation
in the polymorphic Lambek calculus.

Mathematical linguistics is an interdisciplinary field between linguistics and
mathematics that emerged in the second half of the 20th century.
It was known as a natural language processing technology before machine learning
became popular.
We have promoted this field because we believe that mathematical linguistics can
be useful in today's world of generative AI and large language models.
In this talk, we will present our overseas research activities to promote our
research results and our methods for expanding our network.
In addition, recent results in mathematical linguistics will be presented.
