Hi, I am TANIGUCHI Masaya 👋

Masaya Taniguchi graduated from the Information Science Course at TITECH HST. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics from Gakushuin University, followed by his M.S. and Ph.D. in Information Science from JAIST.

Presently, he holds the position of a researcher (SPDR) in the Natural Language Understanding team at RIKEN AIP. Additionally, he is a member of Tohoku NLP, led by Dr. Kentaro Inui, at Tohoku University.

Masaya Taniguchi's research primarily focuses on formal semantics of natural language and programming languages. His keen interests lie in exploring and advancing the understanding of these domains.
