Hi, I am TANIGUCHI Masaya üëã

Masaya Taniguchi graduated from the Information Science Course at JAIST. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics from Gakushuin University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Information Science from JAIST.

Presently, he holds the researcher position (SPDR) in the Natural Language Understanding team at RIKEN AIP. Additionally, he is a member of TohokuNLP, led by Dr. Kentaro Inui, at Tohoku University.

Masaya Taniguchi's research primarily focuses on the formal semantics of natural language and programming languages. His keen interests lie in exploring and advancing the understanding of these domains.
