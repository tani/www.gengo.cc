      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <p>
        Masaya Taniguchi is a researcher position in
        <x-abbr>Natural Language Understanding</x-abbr> team at RIKEN
        <x-abbr>Advanced Intelligence Project</x-abbr>. Additionally, he is a member
        of TohokuNLP, led by Dr. Kentaro Inui, at Tohoku University. He earned
        his <x-abbr>Bachelor of Science</x-abbr> in Mathematics from Gakushuin
        University and his <x-abbr>Master of Science</x-abbr> and Ph.D. in
        Information Science from
        <x-abbr>Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Techonology</x-abbr>. Masaya
        Taniguchi's research primarily focuses on the formal semantics of
        natural language and programming languages. His keen interests lie in
        exploring and advancing the understanding of these domains.

            <p>
              There is a pressing need to make the most of creative and basic research potential if we are to pioneer new frontiers
              in science and technology on a global scale. And for this our greatest hope lies with the work of talented and
              free-thinking young scientists. RIKEN's program for Special Postdoctoral Researchers (SPDR) was instituted to provide
              young and creative scientists the opportunity to be involved in autonomous and independent research that is in line
              with RIKEN objectives and research fields.
